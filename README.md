**This integration is not affiliated with NRGI.**

NRGI is a danish energy company that provides electricity and gas to private and business customers. The company acts like a Distribution System Operator (DSO) and is responsible for the distribution of electricity and gas to the end customer.

## Variable rate API
NRGI offers a variable-rate tariff for electricity. The variable-rate can be used to reduce the electricity bill by using electricity when the price is low. The price can be found on the NRGI website here: https://nrgi.dk/privat/stroem/bliv-klogere-paa-stroem/foelg-timeprisen-paa-stroem.

This API lets you see the variable-rate prices for the next 48 hours. Which can be used to let you know when to use power hungry devices.
